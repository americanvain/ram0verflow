"""
Keeps the chain moving when nothing else is.

Runs on a schedule. If the tip is younger than the target spacing it exits
without doing anything, so an active chain never sees it. If the tip has gone
stale it mines one block at the current difficulty, which pins block spacing
near the target during quiet stretches and lets real miners displace it the
moment they show up.

The reward goes to the address that holds the genesis output, read from the
chain itself, so there is nothing to configure and no key involved: mining
needs only the public address.

Coinbase messages are drawn from satoshinotebook.com, an open-source notebook
